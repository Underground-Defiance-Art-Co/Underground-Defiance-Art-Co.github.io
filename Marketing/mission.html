      <h1>Mission and Impact!</h1>
    
  <h2> Our Mission </h2>
    <p> Here at Underground Defiance Art Collective, we strive to create an inclusive and diverse space for minority artists, dancers, musicians, stage performers, and writers to create and collaborate with each other. We believe that no matter what your disability, race, ethnicity, economic status, sexuality, or gender you deserve an environment that supports, respects, and challenges your artistic endeavors at <b>no<\b> cost to you. We know that art and community can break down societyâ€™s expectations of minorities to make a better world for <b>everyone!</b>
    </p>
