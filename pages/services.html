            <h2>What We Offer</h2>
            <p>
                Along with collective studio spaces, Underground Defiance offers many different events and workshops that are open and accessible to anyone 18+. We also offer after school on Tuesday and Thursday nights for elementary through high school, because we believe that every child deserves to be able to artistically express themselves, we just help them figure out how.
