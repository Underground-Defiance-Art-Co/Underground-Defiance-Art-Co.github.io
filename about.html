<h1> About Us </h1>
<b2> Our Story </b2>
  <p> Underground Defiance was born after our founder, Ren Beck, took an art entrepreneurship course at University of Northern Colorado, in which students had to come up with an idea for a new artistic business. Ren noticed that there were no accessible, free, and inclusive creative spaces centered around marginalized communities in Colorado. As a dancer and writer who is both disabled and queer, Ren is aware of how many creative people in marginalized communities are barred from the arts due to wealth inequality, inaccessibility, or fear of discrimination. They decided then and there that they wanted to create a nonprofit organization to address these issues and create positive social change. Thus, <b> Underground Defiance Art Collective </b> was born!</p>
