        <h1> Welcome! </h1>
<p> Underground Defiance Art Collective will be a community driven non-profit that provides free, inclusive, and accessible studio space, supplies, and workshops to artists, dancers, musicians, writers, and stage performers in minority communities. Our organization will address the lack of accessibility in the arts due to financial, social, or physical limitation reasons. While also simultaneously addressing the lack of third spaces in our current society, Our mission will be to create an environment that is safe and welcoming to everyone within marginalized communities that foster creativity, social justice, and community that feels like family </p>
<h2> Why Websites Matter </h2>
  <p> The reason why having a secure website on the world wide web is like having a storefront on main street is because if done correctly the website can attract people who might not have known about the business before. With most of the worldâ€™s population having access to the internet, marketers can tap into that TAM by using search engine optimization to increase the amount of visibility on places like Google. Much like a good window display, a website draws potential customers in.  </p>
