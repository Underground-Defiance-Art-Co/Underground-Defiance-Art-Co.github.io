        <h1> Welcome! </h1>
<p> Underground Defiance Art Collective will be a community driven non-profit that provides free, inclusive, and accessible studio space, supplies, and workshops to artists, dancers, musicians, writers, and stage performers in minority communities. Our organization will address the lack of accessibility in the arts due to financial, social, or physical limitation reasons. While also simultaneously addressing the lack of third spaces in our current society, Our mission will be to create an environment that is safe and welcoming to everyone within marginalized communities that foster creativity, social justice, and community that feels like family </p>
